## 1. Create SSH key pair

It is fairly simple as `ssh-keygen` will guide you through the whole process. 

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "sunny@example.com"
```
`-C` is a comment that will be added at the end of the public key.

The series of questions after you run the above code looks something like:

```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/sunny/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

You can choose to use all default values or enter your own. 

Once it is complete:
- The public key is now located in `/home/sunny/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- The private key is now located in `/home/sunny/.ssh/id_ed25519`

## 2. Copy public key to the remote server:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 sunny@remote_server_address 
```
`.pub` is automatically added if you specify a filename that does not end with `.pub`. 

This will add your public key to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_key` file. If you open it up, you will see the comment you added when generating via `-C` flag in step 1.

## 3. Add private key to the SSH agent:

[Optional] Start the ssh-agent if it isn't already. If you are not sure, skip it for now and come back if the next step fails.
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.
```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

If you are curious which keys ssh-agent knows about, run:
```
ssh-add -L
```

## 4. Add the remote host to SSH config (just for convenience):
For simplicity, you can add the remote host to your SSH config file (`~/.ssh/config`). If this file does not exist, you can create it manually (`touch ~/.ssh/config`).

Add a block like this:

```
Host remote_server_name
        HostName 123.45.678.90
        User sunny
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now you can SSH to the server by:

```
ssh remote_server_name
```

Instead of:

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 sunny@123.45.678.90
```
