# 5 Ways to Improve Your Quality Inspection Process

If you work in manufacturing and are struggling to with rising costs, returned products, and unhappy customers, check out some of my ideas below on how to improve your quality inspection process. If you have any other ones to add, I would love to hear from you in the comments below! 

### 1. Identify KPIs and Loopholes

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to measure a process' success. One problem with KPIs is that while they may track progress towards a goal, they can often be gamed and measurements can be tweaked to make a metric look better than it truly is. A good KPI is something that is automatically captured from machines and requires little if any human input. 

### 2. Create a Process Diagram

Work with your team to create a [Swim Lane Diagram](https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/swim-lane).  This will give you a better idea what tasks need to be done by what team at what point in the process.  If there are multiple tasks that are done in parallel, which task takes longer to complete? Focusing on the tasks and teams that are involved in a process will help to understand where resources should be put in order to speed up the overall process.  

### 3. Simplify the Tasks

> "Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler" - Albert Einstein

Once you have identified your process bottlenecks, work with your team to break the task down. The goal here is to ensure that any work that is being done is adding value to the process and requires a person. At this point, start considering whether a process can be either partially or fully automated.

### 4. Focus on Quick Wins

One mistake that many companies make when improving their quality inspection process is that they try to tackle too hard of a problem right away. This is an advanced strategy and unless you have a very solid team, it is probably better to start with a smaller process and generate value quicker.  Once your team has started improving the workflow, the larger processes will be easier to optimize. If you feel like there are no smaller processes that need to be optimized, this probably means that the tasks should be broken down into smaller pieces.  

### 5. Work with Your Subject Matter Experts

Don't try to improve the process without working with the people that know the process best.  There are typically years of expertise ready and willing to assist in process improvement.  If you want to generate the highest return on investment from your quality inspection improvements, these team members will help you get there.
